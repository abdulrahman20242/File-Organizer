# ðŸ“‚ File Organizer

A simple and flexible command-line tool written in Python to automatically **organize files** inside a folder.

It provides two organization modes:
1. **Type-based organization** â†’ Group files into folders by file type (Videos, Images, Documents, Audio, etc.)
2. **Name-based organization** â†’ Create individual folders for each file using its filename (without extension)
